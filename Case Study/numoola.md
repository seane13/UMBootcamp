"NuMoola is Selected as a Finalist for the 2021 Pittsburgh Tech 50 Awards" [Numoola](https://numoola.com/news/)
"NuMoola is one of six finalists in the Amazon Alexa EdTech Skills Competition. " [Numoola](https://numoola.com/news/)

Numoola is a small fish in a big fintech pond. However, they set themselves apart from their competitors by gearing its technology toward a younger age range.  

* "A new crop of mobile money apps are promoting themselves as part of the solution to a stubborn problem: a lack of financial savvy, particularly among young Americans."[NY Times](nytimes.com/2021/08/27/business/kids-financial-literacy-apps.html)

Their a number of other companies offering financial services geared toward youth. Most of Numoola's competition sets their sites on the older age ranges. 

* For instance, "Greenlight is a company on a mission to shine a light on the world of money for kids and parents.

The Greenlight card and app were purpose-built for families. Parents get the tools they need to manage their kids’ money and invest for their kids' futures. Kids get real-life lessons in earning, spending, saving, giving and investing."[Greenlight](https://www.greenlight.com/faq/)

According to Crunchbase.com[CB](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greenlight-4) Greenlight has a total funding amount of $565.5M USD. They also have a robust financial platform with a number of features including 
1. Debit Card
2. Investing
3. Financial Literacy
4. No Hidden Fees
5. Chores & Allowance
6. Cash Back & Savings
7. Security & Control 

* "Morgan Stanley teams up with kids money management platform Greenlight"[Finextra](https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/90533/morgan-stanley-teams-up-with-kids-money-management-platform-greenlight)

* Greenlight is a formidable competitor in this domain. Other competitiors include;

1. Copper, "Banking built for teens"[Copper](https://www.getcopper.com/)
2. Gohenry, "The kids debit card & financial learning app"[gohenry](https://www.gohenry.com/)
3. Till, "Till builds smarter spenders"[Till](https://tillfinancial.io/)

## Recommendations

* I would recommend numoola add cryptocurrencies to their platform. This would set them further from the competition and may have more appeal to younger generations.

* In order to expand into the crypto market, they would need to also expand their technology and staff to operate and educate in this domain. 

* Crypto and blockchain are becoming increasing more mainstream. From an educational standpoint, it would be a disservice to not teach such a dominat new technology.
